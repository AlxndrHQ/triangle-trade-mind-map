## ENTITY record (ports, forts, castles, ships, colonies, institutions, laws/charters, smaller firms, legacy institutions)
```json
{ "id":"elmina-castle", "name":"Elmina Castle (São Jorge da Mina)", "type":"entity",
  "kind":"Fort / trading castle" | "Port" | "Ship / voyage" | "Colony / plantation" | "Chartered company" | "Bank / insurer" | "Charter / law / treaty" | "University / church" | "Legacy / apology" | other short label,
  "description":"2–3 factual sentences.", "start":1482, "geo":[5.083,-1.348] (optional, for places), "connections":[...] }
```

## Edge types (use exactly these)
- `ownership` — founded / owned / shareholder / governor of
- `trade` — sold or bought captives, supplied, traded with
- `finance` — loan, credit, insurance, bills of exchange, invested
- `charter` — royal charter, licence, asiento, monopoly grant, appointed by
- `voyage` — sailed for / ship / expedition / commanded
- `plantation` — held plantations / enslaved people at
- `family` — family / marriage / descendant
- `legacy` — successor institution, merged into, apology, reparations, endowment, money flowed to
- `political` — ally, war, treaty, diplomacy, lobbying
- `parallel` — thematic parallel only (no real tie; use sparingly)

## Rules
1. Accuracy over volume. Mainstream academic scholarship only (SlaveVoyages.org, UCL Legacies of British Slavery, national archives, university reports, museum sites, Britannica, peer-reviewed or reputable press). Never use propaganda sources (e.g. Nation of Islam's "The Secret Relationship", white-supremacist or Afrocentric-myth sites). Where claims are contested, say so and mark basis "interpretive".
2. Every profile needs ≥2 sources with real, working URLs you found while searching. Don't invent URLs.
3. Numbers: cite where they come from in the text ("per SlaveVoyages", "per LBS"). Give approximate figures with "c." / "~".
4. Connections: link richly (3–8 per profile) to people, companies, ports, and the SHARED IDs below. Only link to IDs that exist in your own file or in the SHARED REGISTRY. Never create a record whose id is in the registry unless your group OWNS it.
5. Neutral, sober tone. These are records of atrocity; describe roles plainly. Use "enslaved people" / "captives", not "slaves" as a noun where avoidable.
6. "events": 8–15 key dated events for your group: `{"year":1498, "title":"Short title", "text":"1–2 sentences.", "ids":["record-ids","involved"], "source":{"label":"...","url":"..."}}`.
7. Write the file with the Write tool to the exact path given. Validate it parses: `python3 -c "import json;json.load(open('PATH'))"`.

## SHARED REGISTRY (id — name — owning group). Link freely; only the owner creates it.

## ROUND 3 ADDITIONS (these override the lists above)
New categories: "Enslaved & Free Black Lives" and "Arab, Saharan & Indian Ocean".
New roles: "Captain & Crew", "Enslaved & Survivor", "Free & Abolitionist".
For people in "Enslaved & Free Black Lives" the fields mean:
- role_summary → their story: how they were captured/enslaved/freed, what they endured, what they did.
- legacy → descendants and memory today (descendant groups, memorials, books, DNA/genealogy projects, place names).
- scale → how much documentation/impact their story has: "Minor" (a name in a record), "Significant", "Major" (widely documented), "Dominant" (a defining figure, e.g. Douglass); scaleNote explains the sources (narrative, ledger, interview).
- start/end = years enslaved or active (end null only if an organisation/community still exists).
Captains and crew use their usual category ("European Families"/"American Families") with role "Captain & Crew".
Ships, voyages, slave pens and revolts are ENTITIES (kind "Ship / voyage", "Revolt / uprising", "Slave pen / market").

## ROUND 4 ADDITIONS
### Family & lineage fields (optional on any profile)
```json
"lineage": [ {"name":"William Whaley", "relation":"mentor" | "father" | "son" | "daughter" | "spouse" | "partner" | "heir" | "grandson" | "descendant" | "successor firm" | "apprentice" | other short word,
              "years":"c.1700–1760", "note":"1 sentence: who they were and what passed between them (money, ships, land, firm, title)", "id":"existing-record-id-if-any", "basis":"documented"|"interpretive"} ],
"today": "2–4 sentences: what the family / its money / its name is today. Name only PUBLICLY documented descendants (public figures, people who have spoken publicly about the link, peerage titles, published genealogies, family companies or foundations). Never name or describe private individuals (no jobs, addresses, social media of private people). If nothing public is documented, say: 'No publicly documented descendants have been traced.' and say where the wealth went if known (estates sold, firm wound up, bequests)."
```
Order lineage oldest → newest (predecessors/mentors first, then the person's own generation, then heirs down to today).

### New category "Enforcers & Aftermath"
For the middle tier and the post-emancipation enforcement of racial hierarchy. Roles: "Overseer & Enforcer" (overseers, slave-breakers, slave patrols, slave catchers, kidnappers), "Planter & Enslaver" (small slaveholders/yeoman class), "Hate Group & Terror" (Knights of the Golden Circle, KKK eras, White League, Red Shirts, today's factions), "Convict Leasing & Jim Crow" (companies and states that leased convicts).
